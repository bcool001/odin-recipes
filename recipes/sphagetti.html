        <ol>
            <li>Step 1
                <p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                    Cook and stir sausage, mushrooms, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic in the hot oil until sausage 
                    is browned and crumbly, about 20 minutes; drain and discard grease.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Step 2
                <p>Stir tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and olives into sausage mixture; season with oregano, basil, and salt.

            <li> Step 3
                <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                    Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
